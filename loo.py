'''
Library routine to find picture files linked or embedded in an Open
Office document.  call GetOOFilePictures(oofile) with the path to an
OO file and you'll get a list of image files in that document.
 
Run as a script and pass OO files on the command line; their picture
files will be printed to stdout.  Missing image files and image files
that aren't relative to the document's location will be flagged.
 
This is done by a heuristic rather than parsing the XML.

    Usage:  {name} [options] file1 [file2...]
      For each Open Office document file given on the command line, print
      out any image files that the document file has links to.  Highlight
      any missing image (mark with '{missing}').
      
      Image files that are not at or below the same directory as the
      document file will be marked '{notrel}'.  This is done so that
      creating a zip file containing one or more Open Office files will
      have the documents display their images properly when the package is
      unzipped.  You may need to create some hard or soft links to the
      image files for this to work properly.
      
      Image files have extensions:
        bmp  gif  pbm  pgm  psd  sgf  tif  wmf
        dxf  jpeg pcd  plt  ras  sgv  tiff xbm
        emf  jpg  pct  png  sda  svm  vor  xpm
        eps  met  pcx  ppm  sdd  tga
      Open Office document files have extensions
        .odb .odg .odp .ods .odt .ott
      
    Options
      -e
        Also print the names of embedded image files.
      -l
        Just list the encountered Open Office files (i.e., don't list
        their image files).
      -m
        Print only missing or not relative image files.
      -r
        Each 'file' on the command line is a directory.  Recursively search
        it for Open Office files and print the images in the files found.
        If no directories are given on the command line, search the
        current directory tree by default.
      
    Examples
      - '{shortname} -r' will show all the OO files and their images at
        and below the current directory.
      - '{shortname} -l' will do the same, but only display the file
        names.
      - '{shortname} -r dir' will show all the OO files and their images
        at below the directory dir.
