ToDo for /plib
- Standardize
    - Change all *.py in /pylib to use _pgminfo variable
        - desc:  summary paragraph of what module does
        - todo:  Things that need fixing
    - File's docstring
        - Use for detailed usage info for when 'pd file' is used
    - Repository's directory structure
    - Formatting of the python files
    - All files pass linting tool
    - Module behavior
        - Default running behavior is to run self tests
            - Use 'std' for this in <oo test oo>
        - Include "demo" on command line for demo output
        - 'pd module' should tell you what you want to know about using it
    - Testing architecture
        - Hidden file contains hash of each python file
            - Takes about 20 ms to hash /plib's files
        - Testing results file contains dict of filename:last_hash tested
            - Quickly lets tool decide if self tests need to be run
        - Running a script returns 0 if tests pass, != 0 if not
- All self tests pass with python 3.11 (standard version for testing & development)
- Detailed review of all /plib modules will mean many of them disappear, being moved to
  other modules
- Most /plib modules should have self tests that pass
- Documentation
    - Make it easier for someone to browse what's in this repository and find things of
      interest
    - Alphabetical, by subject, point out things I think are of interest
    - Caution about use:  tight coupling can mean it's hard to extract something you're
      interested in.
- Fix old color.py dependencies
- Semantic versioning
    - Important concept for users of software tools
    - Does it apply to my stuff?

    - Developed _pgminfo content; abbreviated it in vi to xi
