ToDo for /plib
- Standardize
    - Change all *.py in /pylib to use _pgminfo variable
        - desc:  summary paragraph of what module does
    - File's docstring
        - Use for detailed usage info for when 'pd file' is used
    - Repository's directory structure
    - Formatting of the python files
    - All files pass linting tool
- Most /plib modules should have self tests that pass
- Documentation
    - Make it easier for someone to browse what's in this repository and find things of interest
    - Alphabetical, by subject, point out things I think are of interest
    - Caution about use:  tight coupling can mean it's hard to extract something you're interested in.
- Fix old color.py dependencies

Done
    - Developed _pgminfo content; abbreviated it in vi to xi
