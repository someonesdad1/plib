It appears sympy covers most of the things I envisioned for an interval
library.  See https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/sets.html.

Let
    ‚Ñù = set of real numbers
    ‚Ñ§ = set of integers = {..., -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
    ‚Ñï = set of natural numbers = {1, 2, ...}
    ‚Ñïùüò = set of natural numbers with zero = {0, 1, 2, ...}
    ‚Ñö = set of rational numbers
    ‚Ñï ‚äÇ ‚Ñïùüò ‚äÇ ‚Ñ§ ‚äÇ ‚Ñö ‚äÇ ‚Ñù
    ‚ÖÄ = arbitrary set of scalars

I think it would make sense to continue work on this module, as the PyPi
libraries I've downloaded on intervals (Page's and a successor) are for
python 2 and interval3 wouldn't pass its self tests.

I think an Interval object ought to be derived from a set, letting it
contain arbitrary heterogeneous objects.  The core need is to be able to
test 'x in Interval' where x is an arbitrary object.  The implementation
would use the underlying set, but include a special container for Rng
objects; this container needs to stay in sorted order for binary
searches when 'in' is used.  The Rng objects define a discrete or
continuous range of scalars.  If you include arbitrary Rng scalars with
e.g. floating point Rng, then the scalars must be orderable with respect
to floats.

Rng objects would need to represent a range of a scalar; the only
property of a scalar needed is that scalars a and b must have the 
relation a < b decidable (i.e., the scalars are orderable).

Start with a document that shows the key use cases and provides examples
of how it typically would be used.  The overriding goal is that it
simulate a set of continuous and discrete intervals and points for
defining a group of scalars.  The primary difference from a regular
python set is that if it contains one or more continuous intervals, it
cannot be iterated over; but of course this is reasonable, as it's an
infinite set.  A property Interval.is_iterable will keep track of this,
which will be False if any continuous Rng object is present or any Rng
object has a boundary point of Infinity.  (In reality, python reals can
be iterated over as they are a finite set.)

It would be interesting to see how well certain mathematical sets could
be modeled.  For example, see if the real line with the integers removed
could be modeled.  This is easy to visualize and describe (‚Ñù - ‚Ñ§).  This
is an interesting use case and it may be possible to do by providing
built-in abstractions of such things.  In fact, they could be encoded
with Unicode characters in the familiar of ‚Ñù ‚Ñ§ ‚Ñï ‚Ñö, as they are allowed
python symbols.

These mathematical sets are easy to describe in code.  For example, ‚Ñù
could be a class whose constructor is ‚Ñù(float, int, Decimal, Fraction,
mpf).  Then x in ‚Ñù would be gotten with

    def __init__(self, *types):
        self.types = types
    def ‚Ñù.__contains__(self, x)
        return any([isinstance(x, i) for i in self.types])

Another way to describe ‚Ñù is Rng(-inf, inf), at least for floats.  To
describe ‚Ñù - ‚Ñ§, you'd want to use Rng(-inf, inf) and NRng(-inf, inf,
integer=True) where NRng is an object which means something must not be
in that set.  Or the arithmetic operator must be able to handle an
expression like 'Rng(-inf, inf) - Rng(-inf, inf, integer=True)'.

‚Ñö is the set of rationals and would be defined by x in Rng(-inf, inf)
and isinstance(x, Fraction).  Note fractions are ordered with respect to
floats and integers, so they work well together.  To support this, the
Rng object could use a keyword 'type'.

Note the general Rng object wouldn't need a type.  Then the only
requirement on Rng(a, b) is that type(a) == type(b) and a and b are
orderable.
        
Use case examples:
    
    - You want a set that contains 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:  I stopped work on this module because someone pointed out that PyPi
had an interval library (see /pylib/other_libs/interval-1.0.0.tar by Jacob
Page).  Unfortunately, this library only runs under python 2.7; when I
convert the docstring test print() statements to python 3 form, the tests
fail.

Page's library is under the LGPL, so it might be worth deriving a new 
library that works under both python 2.7 and 3.6.  I'd want to make sure
that his stuff works with any objects that are orderable (his examples make
me think it does).

Should his core class be derived from a set?  This would allow boolean
operations with regular heterogeneous sets.  This would allow use cases
such as a set that x = set(("cat", "dog", IntervalSet(1, 5))).  Then a
test such as "3.5 in x" would return True.  This models the generality of
sets that one would encounter in practice.  However, it might not be too
efficient, as the "in" operator would be an O(n) operation.  Note his basic
architecture uses a list as the basic container.  More objectionable is
that mathematical sets are not orderable, whereas an IntervalSet is.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Module to provide discrete and continuous intervals and containers of
these intervals.  This module will probably work with python 2.1 or
later (it has been tested with python 2.7.6 and 3.4.0).
 
Most usage will involve numerical points and intervals, so I will often
use the term 'numbers', but the objects defining things only need to be
orderable, so I will call them scalars to connote this ordering.
 
    Example:  you could mix astronomical Julian day objects that were
    represented internally by an mpmath floating point number with
    python's integers and floats as long as you defined the proper
    comparison semantics for the Julian day object with integers and
    floats.
 
Typical use case:  a problem requires input numbers that are restricted
to the integers between 1 and 10 or any floating point numbers between
11 and 15.5.  You'd construct an Interval object that described that
requirement by
 
    interval = Interval(Rng(1, 10, integer=True), (11, 15.5))
 
Given a number x, you would test whether x is in the interval by
whether 'x in interval' or 'x == interval' are True.  Since Rng and
Interval objects model sets of mathematical objects, both objects
support unions and intersections.
 
The module's public symbols are:
 
Interval (class)
    Container of Rng objects and scalars.  The most common use case is
    with numerical objects such as integers, floats, and Decimal numbers,
    but other scalars can be used such as strings or date objects (see
    unit tests for examples).
Rng (class)
    Class that simulates a single discrete or continuous range (i.e.,
    interval) where either end can be open or closed.  Requires
    initialization with two scalars defining the endpoints of the
    range.  The scalars can be different types as long as they can be
    ordered with respect to each other (example:  integers and floats).
    The integer keyword for the constructor allows creating discrete
    ranges.
Eps (class, derived from Rng)
    Convenience class that simulates a continuous numerical range
    specified by a center point and half-width (an "epsilon ball").
    The half-width can be given by either a relative or absolute number
    or it can be derived from a standardized uncertainty with a stated
    coverage factor.
Partition (class, derived from Interval)
    This is a convenience container that holds a partition of a portion
    or all of the real line.  The Partition's Rng objects, when unioned
    together, will result in the original interval.  Call a partition
    object p as a function p(x) and it will return the index of the Rng
    object that contains the scalar x or None if x is not in the
    partition.
Infinity (class)
    Class that emulates the behavior of infinity by comparing larger
    than any other object except itself.  Also supports the four basic
    arithmetic operations and should compare properly with nearly any
    orderable object type.  The is_infinite() method lets you test
    whether an object is infinite.
inf (instance of Infinity class)
    Convenience instance.  Allows construction of semi-infinite
    intervals.  Example:  Interval((0, inf)) constructs an interval
    that models real numbers >= zero.
Range (function)
    Convenience function that replaces python's built-in range().
    Range(inf) works as you'd expect.

    it an interval).  If the constructor's integer keyword is True,
    then the range is discrete and it contains integers; otherwise, it
    is continuous.
 
    The primary uses of Rng objects are:
 
        * Allow testing to see if an object is in the range.
        * Combine two Rng objects into one via addition and
          multiplication, operations analogous to the union and
          intersection of sets, respectively.  Note that the union of
          two disjoint Rng objects can return an Interval object.
          The intersection of two Rng objects can return a Rng object
          with the left endpoint equal to the right (i.e., a scalar).
        * Define an ordering for Rng objects so a container (class
          Interval, below) of them can be sorted, facilitating binary
          searches for membership.  The container allows complicated
          discrete and continuous ranges to be modeled.
 
    The objects used in the constructor do not need to be numbers; the
    only requirement is that they must be orderable amongst themselves.
    Thus, for example, a range can be defined by a pair of strings:
    Rng("a", "z") defines a range that contains the lower case ASCII
    letters (but not all of them; for example, 'zymurgy' won't be
    within this range).  I anticipate that the major use case for Rng
    objects will be with integer and floating point numbers.
 
    Despite the implementation of two "arithmetic" operations (addition
    and multiplication) and the nomenclature, note that Rng objects are
    not intended to model interval arithmetic (see Knuth volume 2 or
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic for more details).

class Eps(Rng):
    ''' This is a convenience subclass of Rng to be used to construct
    ranges about a floating point value using half-widths.  Three
    construction methods are provided:  a relative half-width, an
    absolute half-width, or using a standard uncertainty multiplied by
    a k-factor (for the latter, you need to have the python
    uncertainties library installed; see
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncertainties).  A keyword to the
    constructor allows the range (i.e., interval) to be open or closed
    [default is closed].
 
    The class variable releps is used for the default relative
    precision.  This is set to a value that will probably be convenient
    for for most floating point calculations that haven't involved lots
    of iteration.
 
    Some uses are:
 
        * Provide an interval comparison for dealing with e.g. roundoff
          error in floating point calculations.
        * Provide interval comparisons for physical measurements where
          the uncertainty intervals can be estimated.
 
    For the latter use case, the constructor can be initialized with a
    ufloat() object from the python Uncertainties library.  The
    half-width of the interval is then k times the standard uncertainty
    (this is sometimes called an "expanded uncertainty" and k is
    usually called the coverage factor).

        (see note below).  x is the numerical value and you must supply
        one of releps or eps.  releps is the relative half-width of the
        interval and eps is the direct half-width.  If you supply
        releps, the interval is [x*(1 - releps), x*(1 + releps)] and if
        you supply eps, the interval is [x - eps, x + eps].
 
        If you supply eps, it takes precedence over releps.
 
        k is used in the case where x is an Uncertainties ufloat.  In
        this case, the interval will be [n - k*s, n + k*s] where n is
        the nominal value of the ufloat and s is its standard
        deviation.

        but this class can be used with any orderable objects that have
        floating point semantics for addition, subtraction, and

    (see note below).  The partition is a set of Rng objects that are
    half-open on one end and result in the whole portion of the real
    line when their union is taken.  The primary interface is to call
    the Partition object as a function with a number.  The index of the
    partition this number is in is returned or None if the number is
    not in the partition.
 
    Note:  I've used the common use case of partitioning the real line,
    but since the Partition object is a subclass of Interval and
    Partition's methods do not require any methods of the scalars in
    its Rng objects other than ordering operators, the Partition class
    can be used to partition any discrete or continuous orderable set
    of scalars.
 
    Though a Partition object is an Interval, I've decided that their
    use is specialized and I've not allowed them to have the addition
    and multiplication features of Intervals.  The reason is that, in
    general, they would no longer be Partition objects, which would be
    evidenced that taking the union of their Rng objects would no
    longer give the original interval.  In other words, this union of
    the Rng objects to give the original interval is a class invariant.
