Script to search title & authors of HP Journal (HPJ) articles
 
    The script's information came from HP Labs' site
    https://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/hpjindex.html.  Also see http://hparchive.com
    (by Glenn Robb) and https://worldradiohistory.com/HP-Journal.htm (by David Gleason).  The HP
    Journal was printed from 1949 to 1998.
 
    There were thousands of errors in the text from the above HPL website.  Glenn Robb told me it
    was generated by an HP archivist's intern and from the many types of errors, it was clearly a
    manual process.  I have modernized the titles of the articles to use proper SI units,
    multipliers, spacing between the number and unit, and I've replaced things like '16K' with '16
    kbytes'.  This means you can't search on the original terms, but it makes reading the titles a
    little easier because you're not looking at old terminology.
 
    On my computer, I store all the PDF files in /ebooks/hpj.  This directory is about 17 GB and
    includes the HP Journal PDF files, Measure (an HP magazine for employees), and Bench Briefs.
    There's also a 1957-09-Sputnik.pdf file that's not on the HP website and is a 2 page supplement
    that recorded the Doppler shift of the Sputnik satellite.

    It's likely few people will be interested in this older HP engineering stuff today, but there's
    a lot of technical wisdom in the articles, which were meant to both show off new products and
    technologies and provide a voice and visibility for the engineering staff.  

    The HP Labs page above may give you all you need, as you can search for relevant text and maybe
    find what you want.  This didn't meet my needs because I like to search things from the command
    line, so I put together this script.  I can refine the search as needed, then have the script
    open up the PDFs for the matching journal titles.  If you're interested in using the script
    with the ability to open the PDF files, email me at someonesdad1@gmail.com and I can send you a
    python script that will download the PDFs.

    If you want to use the hpj.py script, it needs some modules from
    https://github.com/someonesdad1/plib:  wrap.py, color.py, and dpopen.py.  If you are
    comfortable working with python it's straightforward to remove these dependencies so it can be
    a standalone script.

    Example of use
    --------------

        I've got a number of HP analog meters (D'Arsonval type) from instrumentation made before
        the onset of digital electronics.  In the early 1960's HP started using the taut band
        design, which they licensed from a German company.  HP used electronic instrumentation to
        generate custom-printed scales for each meter, giving perhaps the best accuracy you could
        get from analog instrumentation (around a percent).

        I remembered seeing an HPJ article by Barney Oliver on this topic, so I ran a search using
        'python hpj.py oliver | grep -i meter' and found '1961-03, Increasing Accuracy in -hp-
        Meters Through Servo Calibrating Methods, by Bernard M. Oliver, pg 1-4'.  I then opened the
        1961-03.pdf HPJ article in my PDF client to read the article.

        These old HP analog meters make nice microbalances.  With a constant current source (HP
        meters were typically 1 mA full scale), you can lift tiny masses with them and it's fun to
        experiment with things like seeing fountain pen ink drying on paper or water evaporating
        from a small piece of thread.  I fooled around with this a couple of decades ago and
        remember one of the hard parts was making mass standards around 1 mg and into the μg range.
        An accidental tiny puff of air from a nostril would make those tiny standards disappear.

        It's still a pleasure to use these old analog instruments and a few of them are still
        working today.  I've got an HP 427A voltmeter that I found on the web in 2021 and
        purchased.  It's still working nicely (it needed cleaning of pots with Deoxit) and has the
        late-model paint and knobs and the analog meter inside was marked as inspected in 1986,
        which was near the end of the product's life, having been introduced in the 1967 HP
        catalog.  This transistorized design can run off the AC line and consumes a fraction of a
        watt of power, so I leave it powered on.  At the same time I got this meter, a friend gave
        me one of his old Simpson 260 meters, another well-known analog meter.  A nice feature of
        the Simpson VOM is that it can measure voltages even if its batteries are dead, something
        modern DMMs can't do.
