---------- Basic substitution using .def
.# Note the space between '.' and 'def':  shouldn't matter
.     def tsub_h = Hello
Both 'Hello' should have a leading space:
tsub_h
.(
    t.print(f"{purl} Hello", file=e)
.)
.
.
---------- Basic substitution using ..def
The following should have no leading space
..def tsub_h =Hello
tsub_h
.(
    t.print(f"{purl}Hello", file=e)
.)
---------- Substitution of a string containing a space
The text to be substituted is '44 888'.  We'll replace it with 'xx'.
.def 44 888 =xx
44 888
.(
    t.print(f"{purl}xx", file=e)
.)
---------- Include a file with .include
---------- .on and .off


The following line should be empty
.(
    print(f"{purl}End of test", file=e)
.)
