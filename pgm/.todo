* wrap.py:  Add a Block object that is like wrap, but justifies both the
  right and left margins.
  
* flt:  add the engsi feature that will print a prefix with a unit.
  If it's a multiple unit, surround it in (...).

* f.py:  Test_sigcomp() fails.

* f.py:  see line 150 in test/lwtest_test.py.  
    
    b = cpx(1+1j)
    b.promote = 0
    a = cpx(1+1j, units="m")
    Then in debugger, both a==b and a!=b are False

* lwtest.py:  https://realpython.com/python-with-statement/#testing-for-exceptions-with-pytest
  shows pytest's raises as a context manager.  Note

    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError) as exc:
        1/0
    assert str(exc.value) == "division by zero"

  which lets you check that the exception gives the required error
  message.  I've started the changes for this, but ran into a bug 
  in test/lwtest_test.py caused by f.py problems, so that needs to be
  fixed before I can test the lwtest.py changes.

Low priority

* geom_prim.py:  Update properties to modern syntax, utilize matrix.py
  for determinants, as this would remove dependency on numpy.

* u.py and f.py:  A notation for using SI prefixes could be to use
  something like Î¼(N*s/m^2).  This might not be acceptable SI syntax,
  but it would be understandable by anyone and I should use it if the
  tokenizer in the u.py script can be made to
