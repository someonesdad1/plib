      The lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs comes from WordNet
      3.1, slightly edited.  Some of the entries contain space characters,
      meaning this script's output can contain more words than you would think
      from the command line specification.
    Options:
      -s s  Seed the random number generator.  Normally, it is seeded by the
            clock and is unpredictable.
      -n n  How many lines to print out (defaults to {num})
      -p    Print the list of words in each category given on the command line
