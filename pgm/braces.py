    - Change architecture:  no exception for parity error.  Focus on getting test data
      needed and adapt Report() to use that information.  Eliminate -p option unless it
      remains easy.
        - Goal is to quickly locate the source of the error.  Since this will be a user
          with an editor the most, the line/col numbers are the most important.
    
Definitions
    - A brace pair is a pair of characters (a, b) defined where a is the opening
      character and b is the closing character.
    - Parity is a number associated with each defined character.  a's parity is +1 and
      b's parity is -1.
    - Parity sum is the sum of each brace pair's parity values over the whole file.  For
      a brace pair to be declared OK, the parity sum must be zero at the end of the
      file.
    - The parity sum at any point in the file must be >= 0.  If the sum is negative, it
      is considered an error condition.
    
Processing algorithm
    - The character pairs are kept track of by the dictionary g.char_pairs; the
      character is the key and the character's associated Char instance is the value.
    - Each character of the input file is examined to see if it is in g.char_pairs.  If
      it is, the character, offset, and line number are passed to the Char instance for
      logging.

    - Also make work for bytes instead of strings
    - Tokenize python code and set all string content to space characters to maintain
      character offsets.  Then process for braces.  The tokenizing might have to be done
      as bytes, not strings.

        This script helps find brace-type character errors in programming expressions.
        An example is the following python expression:

        which is missing a ')' character.
        
        Most of the time your compiler/interpreter or editor can do such things, but
        there are situations when they may fail you.  An example is a large shell script
        written without functions, say thousands of lines long.  A missing brace-type
        character ('(', '[', or '{' or its matching character) can lead to head
        scratching searches for where the problem is.  Older C compilers could have a
        similar issue pointing out where a missing brace '}' was.
        
        This script looks at each character of a file and if it is in the set of
        recognized "brace-type" character pairs (defined by the -c and -C options), its
        location is logged.  At the end of processing the file, these logged locations
        are examined to find pairs of brace-type characters that are mismatched.  For
        example, the string '{}' has matched braces, but '{{}' does not, nor do '{',
        '{', or '}{'.
