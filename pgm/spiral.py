'''
Calculate parameters of an Archimedean spiral.  The units of length are arbitrary; the program
assumes that the diameters, lengths, and thicknesses all have the same physical unit.
 
Examples:

    1.  I have a toilet paper roll.  The paper is 0.068 mm thick, the roll is 120 mm in outside
        diameter, and the inside diameter is 44 mm.  What is the length of paper on the roll?
 
            Choose problem 1; enter t = 0.068, D = 120, d = 44.  Get
                n = 558.824 turns
                L = 143959 mm = 144 m
 
    2.  How big in diameter will be 1000 turns of sheet metal 0.01 units thick?

            Choose problem 3; enter number of turns n and thickness t.  Get
                L = 31415.9
                D = 20
 
    3.  I have a piece of 2" steel pipe that has an ID of 2.07 inches.  If a US dollar bill is
        6.1 inches long, 2.61 inches wide, and 0.0043 inches thick, how many dollar bills could I
        roll up and put into the pipe?

            Choose problem 1 and input t = 0.004, D = 2.07, d= 0.  Get
                L = 782.6"
                n = 240.7

        If we take int(782.6/6.1), we get 128 bills.  Practically, there are some physical
        limitations that would reduce this number.  The bills couldn't be wound tightly starting
        from zero radius.  You'd also probably want to use some tape to hold the ends of the bills
        together; this would add to the thickness, reducing the number of bills in the roll.
        Finally, bills that had been crumpled probably wouldn't lie quite as flat as new bills.  I
        would thus probably reduce the estimate by 10-20% and declare the amount to be 100 bills.
        Thus, if the bills were $100 bills, a 2 inch pipe could then store $10k for every 2.7
        inches of length.

    4.  Suppose I want to design a phonograph pen tester that will draw a line on paper in the
        shape of a spiral.  The pen writes a line 0.5 mm wide and I want there to be 0.25 mm
        between the lines.  Therefore, I pick the thickness t to be 0.75 mm.  I'll start the line
        at a diameter of d = 25 mm and stop the line at a diameter of D = 1500 mm.  Calculate the
        drawn length by calling the script with '-1 1500 25 0.75':

            Outside diameter    = 1500
            Inside diameter     = 25
            Thickness           = 0.75
            Number of turns     = 983.33333
            Length              = 2355540.2
            Angle               = 6178.4656 rad = 354000°

        Divide the length by 1000 to get 2356 m.  By turning the paper over, I can draw a line of
        4.7 km on one sheet of paper.  I estimate it will take about 3 s to draw 200 mm, so the
        pen speed is about 70 mm/s.  The time to draw 2356 m is then 2355540/70 = 33650 s or 9.3
        hours.  
        
        The tester would need to know the radius of the pen to be able to keep the linear speed of
        the rotating paper constant.

        The polar equation of an Archimedean spiral is
        
            r = a*θ
        
        The arc length of the spiral is gotten by integrating this equation (the arc length formula

        variables.  This is done by a Newton-Raphson root-finding routine.
     
        Example:
            I have a roll of toilet paper and the paper is t = 0.068 mm thick.  The outside diameter D
            is 120 mm and the inside diameter d is 44 mm.  What length of toilet paper is on the roll?
            We have
                t = 0.068
                D = 120
                d = 44
            Call the script with '-1 120 44 0.068':
                Outside diameter    = 120
                Inside diameter     = 44
                Thickness           = 0.068
