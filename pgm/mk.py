    Usage:  {sys.argv[0]} [options] [kfile]
      Monitors the files given on the separate lines of the text file
      kfile and when the source file is newer than the destination file,
      a command is invoked with the indicated target.  The lines of kfile
      must be of the forms (blank lines ignored)
          # This is a comment
          src, dest, cmd
      where src is the name of the source file, dest is the name of the
      destination file, and cmd is a command list to execute when src is
      newer than dest.  cmd can be a list of commands separated by ';'
      characters.
    
      If no kfile is given on the command line, the script's name has
      '.py' removed and '.mk' substituted; this file is looked for in the
      current directory and used if it is found.
    Use case
      I use this script when working on documentation that uses restructured
      text that gets converted to an HTML file.  It works well when you can set
      your browser up to automatically reload a file when it changes.
    Example
        # Example kfile to construct an HTML file when a restructured
        # text file or CSS file change their contents.
        project.rst, project.html, make project.html
        project.css, project.html, make project.html
      will cause make to be called if either project.rst or project.css
      are newer than project.html.
    Options
      -h    Print this message
      -n    Echo the commands that would be executed but don't call
            them.
      -s t  Sleep time t in s between checking file times.  t can be a
            floating point number.  Default is {st} seconds.
