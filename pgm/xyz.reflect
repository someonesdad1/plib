# Example of using reflections
ijk

# Make the first point 
. 1, 1, a

# Make a copy, then reflect it about the origin
b = a.copy
reflect o, b

# Reflect b about the x axis to get the third point
c = b.copy
reflect i, c

# Reflect b about the y axis to get the fourth point
d = b.copy
reflect j, d

# Show the four points
print a, b, c, d
