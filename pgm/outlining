Outlining in vim
    - Folding by indentation is a powerful and fast tool with vim in a
      textfile.
    - With the modelines at the bottom of the screen, I can have things
      indented by two spaces and thus cram a number of levels in.  However,
      things look better for indented lists with an indent of 4.

    To Do lists
        - [ ] Item 1
        - [x] Item 2
        - [!] Item 3
        - [.] Item 4
        
        The x means done, ! means critical problem, . means currently being
        worked on.

    Indenter
        - Indenting script
            - It would be useful to have an indenting script that would
              maintain a set of lists making up an outline.  This would be
              bound to a macro that runs the whole file through the script.
              It would be fast and keep things properly organized.
            - In fact, it could be a C program.  All it has to do is look for
              the lines starting with the bullet symbols, set the new indent
              state, then wrap the lines to that indent.  This would keep
              going until the next blank line or until a new bullet line.  
            - It probably should support .on and .off control words to allow
              for sections that shouldn't be adjusted.

    Modelines
        * ts is tabstops
        * sw is shiftwidth
        * tw is textwidth (set to 0, vi defaults to 80 columns)
        * wm is wrapmargin, which means to wrap at ($COLUMNS - wm) 
        * formatoptions are how lists are formatted; you need 'n' to get the
          list formatting desired in this document.

        To see where a variable was set, use e.g. ':verbose set fo?'.  Web

    Thoughts
        - The idea is attractive as your data are available on all machines
        - Interface won't be as slick as custom-compiled apps
        - Worry about proprietary information stored in cloud Outlining tools

                - I won't use it, as under Chrome it demanded you install some
                  extension to Chrome
            - Google Docs (iOS, Android, Web)
    - Looks
        - OneNote
            - MS 365 Family:  $100/yr with 1 TB/person of cloud storage
                - Word, Power Point, Excel, Outlook, OneNote
                - Runs on Mac, Windows, iOS, Android
            - Visually powerful, lots of platforms
            - Sync to cloud
            - Put information anywhere on page
            - Works with a pen for drawing input on tablet
            - Hierarchical organization, but appears visually too loose
            - Appears aimed at collecting ideas, research, etc.
            - Would likely work well with polishing in Word
        - Scrivener
            - Aimed at writers
            - Break things down into separate files, then combine back into
              whole
            - The outliner is a flexible TOC you can edit
            - https://scrivener.app/ gives a summary (it's by seller).
              There's a 10 minute video intro.
            - From the video (which hung after 2 minutes) and reading its
              transcript, the features I like are outlining, synopsis, and
              corkboard.  These are different ways of viewing your work and
              Scrivener supports the nonlinear way that ideas and writing
              happen.  You can easily move things around.
            - The binder is on the left, organizing everything in the project.
            - A synopsis is a chunk that describes what something is, giving
              you enough detail to tell you what to write later.
            - The Draft, Research, and Trash sections are always there (you
              can add others).  I like this organization.
            - When you're ready to share, use Compile to put everything into
              an exported file (e.g. PDF, Word, ebooks).
        - Evernote
            - Basic is free, so could try out
            - Aimed at data gathering
            - Basic word processor with search
            - Runs on iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Web
            - A power tool is the ability to scan things with phone pictures
              into Evernote (business cards, manuals, etc.) and letting you
              get rid of the paper copy
            - Would likely be a good tool for collaborating workers
    - Opinions
        - What I would really like is an option for one of these tools to send
          the editing of a bunch of text to an external program.  This would
          e.g. let me use vim or gvim to quickly get the text down I want.
          It could do it with some simple markup to allow basic formatting
          when reading back in.
        - Cost:  either $100 once or $100/year
        - Concern
            - Though I might like a specialized tool like Scrivener, I worry
              about the editing process with a customer like B&K.  They would
              want either Word or PDF for most stuff.  The common denominator
              is Word and it can be used to share/comment/integrate.  
                - One workflow would be to convert to Word, have them edit and
                  comment, then I'd have to integrate their comments back into
                  Scrivener.  Except for small changes, this could be time
                  consuming and inefficient.  Or I take a PDF of their
                  comments and make changes directly into Scrivener.
                  Ultimately, it would depend on how much better Scrivener is
                  for composition, research, and editing.  I suspect Scrivener
                  compartmentalizes much better than Word.
        - Though I'm concerned about sharing info on the Web, an exception
          might be Google Docs, as B&K is willing to share their stuff there.
          Then the app is available on all platforms at no cost, a real
          benefit.
            - I probably should try out Google Docs in more detail to see how
              it works as an outlining tool. 
                - In Chrome, edit chrome://flags and search for "force dark"
                  and you can change to dark mode for all websites.
                    - Alas, Google Docs still uses a white page.
                - https://www.guidingtech.com/google-docs-dark-mode-chrome
                  talks about some extensions.  I tried an extension from a
                  guy in Mexico, but it didn't work in Docs.  This page talks
                  about Dark Reader, Luna Reader.  However, there's a real
                  risk of exploitation from Chrome extensions:  see
                  https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/many-chrome-extensions-are-stealing-your-personal-information-heres-how-to-tell-if-youre-at-risk.html
                  Because of this, I won't use an extension.
    - Next step
        - Evaluate Scrivener
            - Sound basic architecture:  Draft, Research, and Trash
            - Corkboard good for reorg & high level view ("index cards")
            - Incorporate a ToDo list
            - Hopefully it uses the MVC pattern, which will let me have
              multiple windows open at once.
                - This is critical for folks with two monitors, as my portrait
                  monitor is used for seeing long sections of text and the
                  landscape one is for high-level overviews.
            - Installation was simple, except there's no easy way to read the
              ridiculously long license agreement in the tiny window -- I
              couldn't copy it to the clipboard.
