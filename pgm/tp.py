<oo 
    Tool for working with text files like markdown and LaTeX.  Commands can be put on
    lines that control the output.  The commands are

    ðŸŸ¦#              Comment line, not sent to stdout
    ðŸŸ¦on             Output is turned on
    ðŸŸ¦off            Output is turned off
    ðŸŸ¦toggle         Output state is toggled
    ðŸŸ¦include file   Include the text in a file
    ðŸŸ¦sinclude file  Include the text in a file; no error if file not found

    Inline abbreviations:

    ðŸŸ¦date    Current date like '13 Jan 2025'
    ðŸŸ¦time    Current time like '09:26:16 am'
    ðŸŸ¦dttm    Current date/time like '01 Oct 2025 09:26:47 am Wed'
    ðŸŸ¦ema1    My email address 'someonesdad1@gmail.com'
    ðŸŸ¦ema2    My alternate email address 'clinkcalfrub@protonmail.com'
    ðŸŸ¦addr    My address '4030 N. Shamrock Ave., Boise ID 83713'
    ðŸŸ¦phon    My phone '208-409-5134'

    The ðŸŸ¦ character was chosen to mark control lines because it's very visible on my
    white on black terminals and it's unlikely to be used in anything I write.

        This script is used to turn on & off chunks of text in a text document.  Here's
        some example text in a file named 'myfile'
        
            ðŸŸ¦# This is a comment that's ignored
            ðŸŸ¦off
            Introductory comments & documentation that won't be in the output.
            ðŸŸ¦on
            This is the main body of the text.
            ðŸŸ¦sinclude data/axiliary_file
            ðŸŸ¦off
            This is material that won't be seen at the end of the file.
        
        With the command 'python tp.py myfile', you'll get one line of output as 'This
        is the main body of the text.' and the text, if any, in the file
        data/auxiliary_file.
        
        Primary use case
        
            I use this tool to process a text file with markdown syntax to e.g. get HTML
            output.  To minimize build time and make it easy to view the output in a
            browser, I put 'ðŸŸ¦on' and 'ðŸŸ¦off' around the section of text I'm working on,
            allowing me to ignore the other text in the file.  
        
            I've got a project that's pushing 20000 lines of text and it uses this
            ðŸŸ¦on/ðŸŸ¦off functionality in a number of ways.  For the case of showing only
            the stuff I'm currently working on, I use the lines 'ðŸŸ¦on xx' and 'ðŸŸ¦off
            xx', showing that you can put extra text on the command line and it's
            ignored.  This lets me later search for 'xx' to find these temporary
            commands.  I also use 'ðŸŸ¦# xx To do item' to mark items that need attention.
        
            Another use is for making internal notes to the document about questions,
            thoughts, or tasks that need to be done.  I might use 'ðŸŸ¦on Note...' and
            'ðŸŸ¦off Note...' for these, particularly if they are longer than a few lines.
        
            To mark my current working spot in a file, I might use 'ðŸŸ¦#yy'.
        
        ðŸŸ¦include and ðŸŸ¦sinclude
        
            The ðŸŸ¦include and ðŸŸ¦sinclude commands are conveniences to insert the text
            from other files.  These files are processed recursively and any commands
            they have in them will affect the overall state.  This can conceivably
            result in confusion if a command is buried deep in one of the files.  To
            help find where the problem is, launch the script with the -d option and the
            file and line number of all the commands will be printed, interspersed with
            the normal text.  Or use the -l option and you'll only see the control lines
            and they are printed in different colors to make it easier to spot the
            offending line.  If you e.g. suspect a wayward ðŸŸ¦on command, use -l and
            apply 'grep on' to the output.
        
            The standard commands are ðŸŸ¦on, ðŸŸ¦off, etc.  However, in rare cases it may
            be that such strings interfere with the content of your files.  In this
            case, you can use the -p (for 'prefix') option to change the command
            strings.  These strings will be inserted in the regex in the global variable
            g.command_line_regex, so you'll want to escape with a backslash any
            characters that have special meaning to python regular.  You may need two
            backslashes, depending on your shell.
