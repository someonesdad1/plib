    - Add .{ and .} for code sections, primarily to allow text substitution.
        - Candidate for macro naming: ðŸŸ¦ (sj in vi, chr(0x1f7e6)), as this is nicely
          visible when editing (even in cygwin's windows) and would never be seen in
          normal text.  Also works well for marking things in HTML when using markdown.
        - '-m file' option reads in macro definitions (python code whose names get put
          into a namespace dict) or just use '.include' to read in the definitions
        - Macros are in a python global dict named 'macros'.  This lets you change/add
          definitions with e.g.
            - .{
            - counter = 0
            - amount = 47.3
            - customer = "B&K Precision"
            - def Func(a):
            -     print("a")
            - .}
        - Debugging mode shows when macro changes

        This script is used to turn on & off chunks of text in a text document.  Here's
        some example text in a file named 'myfile'

            .# This is a comment that's ignored
            .off
            Introductory comments & documentation that won't be in the output.
            .on
            This is the main body of the text.
            .sinclude data/axiliary_file
            .off
            This is material that won't be seen at the end of the file.

        With the command 'python tp.py myfile', you'll get one line of output as 'This
        is the main body of the text.' and the text, if any, in the file
        data/auxiliary_file.

        Primary use case

            I use this tool to process a text file with markdown syntax to e.g. get HTML
            output.  To minimize build time and make it easy to view the output in a
            browser, I put '.on' and '.off' around the section of text I'm working on,
            allowing me to ignore the other text in the file.  

            I've got a project that's pushing 20000 lines of text and it uses this
            .on/.off functionality in a number of ways.  For the case of showing only
            the stuff I'm currently working on, I use the lines '.on xx' and '.off xx',
            showing that you can put extra text on the command line and it's ignored.
            This lets me later search for 'xx' to find these temporary commands.
            I also use '.# xx To do item' to mark items that need attention.

            Another use is for making internal notes to the document about questions,
            thoughts, or tasks that need to be done.  I might use '.on nn' and '.off nn'
            for these, particularly if they are longer than a few lines.  Otherwise I
            might use the '.#' command for a comment line.

            To mark my current working spot in a file, I might use '.#yy'.

        .include and .sinclude

            The .include and .sinclude commands are conveniences to insert the text from
            other files.  These files are processed recursively and any commands they
            have in them will affect the overall state.  This can conceivably result in
            confusion if a command is buried deep in one of the files.  To help find
            where the problem is, launch the script with the -d option and the file and
            line number of all the commands will be printed, interspersed with the
            normal text.  Or use the -l option and you'll only see the control lines and
            they are printed in different colors to make it easier to spot the offending
            line.  If you e.g. suspect a wayward .on command, use -l and apply 'grep on'
            to the output.

            The standard commands are .on, .off, etc.  However, in rare cases it may be
            that such strings interfere with the content of your files.  In this case,
            you can use the -p (for 'prefix') and -s (for 'suffix') options to change
            the command strings.  These strings will be inserted in the regex in the
            global variable g.command_line_regex, so you'll want to escape with a
            backslash any characters that have special meaning to python regular.  You
            may need two backslashes, depending on your shell.
