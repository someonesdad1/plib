    This script details my thinking on coming up with a set of color names
    for my own use.  My impression from collecting samples of color names
    over the years (see rgbdata.py) is that there are way too many names.
    Part of this comes from commercial paint companies defining many colors
    for their products.  This is understandable, considering the fickleness
    of many consumers.  However, for use on a color monitor (which is my
    only interest), having on the order of ten thousand names is overkill.

    Starting from these names, I'd like color names to have no spaces

    standard deviation of 3.7 characters.  This leads me to want all

    deviations, which I'd call about 16 characters.  Hence, I decided
    all names should be 15 characters or less.

    One of the features of these names is that they are all six or less
    characters, consistent with on of the goals.  Part of the
    motivation for this was the 6 character hex specifications, which
    include a '@', '#', or '$' leader character identifying what the
    numbers represent (HSV, RGB, or HLS).

    These names are also pretty easy to make matches with a few
    characters.  For r732 I first used 'blood', which worked well but
    confused searches with the 'blu' elements.  I then chose 'cherry'
    as an alternate.  For the vv color, I liked 'grape', but it
    clashed with the first two letters of green, so other names like
    wine, jam, jelly, orchid, indigo, mauve, iris, etc.  Wine won over
    lilac because it was shorter and a typical red wine is darker than
    our lilac plants' blooms.

    Because these names are both subjective and preloaded in many
    minds, many folks will argue with my picks.  Yet remember the goal
    was a six letter or less name that would describe the color
    'adequately'.  My primary goal for this project was to come up with
    on the order of 2**8 colors that could be used for my day-to-day
    work.  Having 2**9 would be OK, but just a little large.  Another
    primary goal was to have names that exhibited regularity and
    predictability.  Once working on this project I realized it would
    be possible to calculate the color's RGB values from the name once
    the naming scheme was regularlized.  This is nice because I am
    often using a variety of color specifiers, such as names, hex
    strings, RGB, HSV, and HLS.

    It's also convenient to have an inverse to the wl2rgb function by

    Frequency is int(1e5/nm) for wavelength nm in nm.  Note the hue
    ranges over only 0-212 for return values of wl2rgb().  Higher
    numbered hues are problematic since hues wrap around to red as they
    approach 255 from below.  This is a discontinuity we need to deal
    with.  Here are these higher hue numbers converted to their
    equivalent RGB values with lightness = 128 and saturation of 255:

    A plot of "frequency" versus hue is nonlinear, so I decided the
    best way to get an inverse is to create a dictionary of hue versus
    wavelength and use that for lookups.  As soon as the equivalent
    hue is above 212, the color automatically becomes red.  Not ideal,
    but it's a limitation of the mapping in wl2rgb().  Ultimately, we
    should judge wl2rgb() by how well it seems to reproduce the visible
    spectrum to our eyes.  Here's a terminal-based approximation that
    fits on one line:

    This looks to be identical (not suprisingly) to the simulated
    spectrum in the file spectrum.png, which was constructed with
    Bruton's FORTRAN algorithm to make a PPM file.  When I was a
    student, we had access to a monochromator by Bausch & Lomb and I
    would like to use that to compare to what I see on my screen.  That
    monochromator used a diffraction grating to get its colors and they
    seemed to be very pure colors when you looked at the output (and
    the dial was calibrated in wavelength).  You might want to compare
    the colors to those at
    https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ColorsOfTheVisibleSpectrum/.  I
    don't recall seeing the purple/magenta colors in the actual
    physical spectrum (at least not as simulated by the wl2rgb()
    function), but that was in the 1960's and my memory is a bit hazy.

    Here's the relationship between color and wavelength.  The first
    column is wavelength in nm.  The second column is the hue of the
    color calculated by the wl2rgb() function.  The third column is the
    hue of the wavelength in nm calculated by rgb2wl(); the hue is
    shown in the color from wl2rgb(), so the two shown colors should be
    identical if we did a good job of generating an inverse.  The Diff
    columns show the nonzero numerical differences in hue and
    wavelengths.  The hue differences should be zero, but the
    wavelengths will differ by 0 or 1 for a good fit (the differences
    of 1 come about because not all wavelengths map to an integer hue)
    over all except the reds.

    Not suprisingly, the inverse for wavelength is poor for the reds
    approaching the infrared.  Note the lack of dimming because gamma
    was set to zero in wl2rgb().
