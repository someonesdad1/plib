* I see two options for the module files for testing:

    * Put in a trigger string that identifies the file as ready for
      testing if you pass it the --test option.
    * Do nothing with the file.  If there is a test for it, it's in 
      the test directory.
    * Or, the trigger string can either be '--test' or the name of the
      test file(s) to run.
    * Trigger string can be #∞test∞#.  There should be two of them.  If
      the content is not --test, then it's executable python code that
      will give you a tuple of test files to run.  If there are no
      parentheses or square brackets, then it's a single file.  If it's
      'do_not_test', then there's no test.
