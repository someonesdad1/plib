* Make frange work with flt
* wire.py:  Change to use flt with proper units.  Update
  MaxCurrentDensity to use the chassis current data Richard alerted me
  to (it's in pgm/cu_wire.py).  Also do similar for Ampacity.
* atm.py:  See if it can change over to use flt for calculations with
  units.  It will get rid of the sig() ugliness.
* gauge_sizes.py:  Change the floats to flt with units of inches.


* Look at fileinfo.py.  It might make more sense to derive it from
  namedtuple.  This should be combined with filesizes.py into one file.
  In fact, what would make the most sense would to be combine them with
  pathlib to produce a pathlib object that also contained the os.stat
  information for a file when desired (it would only retrieve it if you
  ask for the attribute).

* geom_prim.py:  Update properties, utilize matrix.py for determinants,
  as this would remove dependency on numpy.

* get.py:  Put all stuff in here used to get things.  Include stuff from
  getinput.py, getnumber.py, and gettokens.py.  Everything should be in
  one file including all the tests.

* module_dependencies.py needs to be rewritten to accommodate /pylib.
  The tools and programs need to be moved in first.  Is it even
  necessary?

* mystr.py:  Convert token naming to a class.

* sig is a mess of code.  Is it really all needed?  Maybe it would be
  best to move the key stuff to flt and cpx.  It can still be kept
  around for when it's needed.
