* get.py:  Put all stuff in here used to get things.  Include stuff from
  getinput.py, getnumber.py, and gettokens.py.  Everything should be in
  one file including all the tests.

    * In GetLines, consider getting rid of the regex argument.  I could
      only find the following files that appear to use it:

        pgm/population.py
            Used it to get rid of comments with 
            regex = [r"^\s*#"]
        pgm/words_make_universal.py
            Same thing

      Actually, the use case is fairly compelling, but I think the
      interface should be changed to not return meta.  Then you just
      need to understand that the regexes are used to remove lines you
      don't want.
    * Actually, the xfms keyword hasn't been used, so it would make more
      sense to get rid of.

Low priority

* geom_prim.py:  Update properties to modern syntax, utilize matrix.py
  for determinants, as this would remove dependency on numpy.

* u.py and f.py:  A notation for using SI prefixes could be to use
  something like Î¼(N*s/m^2).  This might not be acceptable SI syntax,
  but it would be understandable by anyone and I should use it if the
  tokenizer in the u.py script can be made to utilize it.  A way to do
  this might be to simply insert the equivalent number with a
  multiplication sign on the right when it's encountered; this should
  evaluate OK with python's parser.

* module_dependencies.py:   Is it necessary?  It needs to be rewritten
  to accommodate /plib.  The tools and programs need to be moved in
  first.  

* sig is a mess of code.  Is it really all needed?  Maybe it would be
  best to move the key stuff to flt and cpx.  It can still be kept
  around for when it's needed.
