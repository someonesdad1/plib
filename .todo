* Go through each of the pushed files, clean them up, add test support
  if needed, and rewrite code if needed, getting rid of python 2 syntax.

  * Add the needed support files like asciify.script, etc.

* Put archimedean.py in util.py or combine the math formulas into a
  single file.

* sig is a mess of code.  Is it really all needed?  Maybe it would be
  best to move the key stuff to flt and cpx.  It can still be kept
  around for when it's needed.

* 8 May 2021 09:41:21 AM:  copied /pylib files that import OK into
  python 3 to this directory and pushed them.

* I see two options for the module files for testing:

    * Put in a trigger string that identifies the file as ready for
      testing if you pass it the --test option.
    * Do nothing with the file.  If there is a test for it, it's in 
      the test directory.
    * Or, the trigger string can either be '--test' or the name of the
      test file(s) to run.
    * Trigger string can be #∞test∞#.  There should be two of them.  If
      the content is not --test, then it's executable python code that
      will give you a tuple of test files to run.  If there are no
      parentheses or square brackets, then it's a single file.  If it's
      'do_not_test', then there's no test.
