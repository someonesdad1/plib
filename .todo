* flt("1_1") gives an exception, but it should be flt(11).

* fmt.py:  Add support for mpmath numbers, fractions, floats in the
  constructor, as str(x) isn't going to work for all the desired
  situations.

* Change what.py to use a what trigger string.  This lets a what string
  be put into any file without having to run the file.

* Go through each of the pushed files, clean them up, add test support
  if needed, and rewrite code if needed, getting rid of python 2 syntax.
  Try to remove as many files from the test directory, which makes it
  easier to distribute files.

    * Add the needed support files like asciify.script, etc.

* Put archimedean.py in util.py or combine the math formulas into a
  single file.

* sig is a mess of code.  Is it really all needed?  Maybe it would be
  best to move the key stuff to flt and cpx.  It can still be kept
  around for when it's needed.

* atm.py:  See if it can change over to use flt for calculations with
  units.  It will get rid of the sig() ugliness.
