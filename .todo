* Change what.py to use a what trigger string.  This lets a what string
  be put into any file without having to run the file.

* Go through each of the pushed files, clean them up, add test support
  if needed, and rewrite code if needed, getting rid of python 2 syntax.

    * Add the needed support files like asciify.script, etc.

* Put archimedean.py in util.py or combine the math formulas into a
  single file.

* sig is a mess of code.  Is it really all needed?  Maybe it would be
  best to move the key stuff to flt and cpx.  It can still be kept
  around for when it's needed.
