* _goto.py:  get it working in /plib/pgm.  Get rid of the silly g()
  shell function and do everything in a python script, as it would be
  so much easier.

* wrap.py:  There should be two spaces after a ':' at the end of a word.
  Also need to add .on and .off directives (those lines are deleted) to 
  start or stop wrapping.

Low priority

* geom_prim.py:  Update properties to modern syntax, utilize matrix.py
  for determinants, as this would remove dependency on numpy.

* u.py and f.py:  A notation for using SI prefixes could be to use
  something like Î¼(N*s/m^2).  This might not be acceptable SI syntax,
  but it would be understandable by anyone and I should use it if the
  tokenizer in the u.py script can be made to utilize it.  A way to do
  this might be to simply insert the equivalent number with a
  multiplication sign on the right when it's encountered; this should
  evaluate OK with python's parser.

* module_dependencies.py:   Is it necessary?  It needs to be rewritten
  to accommodate /plib.  The tools and programs need to be moved in
  first.  

* sig is a mess of code.  Is it really all needed?  Maybe it would be
  best to move the key stuff to flt and cpx.  It can still be kept
  around for when it's needed.
