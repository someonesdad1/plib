* lwtest.py:  check_equal needs to handle flt and cpx.  Also look at 
  check_float and check_complex.  Add test cases to test/lwtest_test.py.

* get.py:  Put all stuff in here used to get things.  Include stuff from
  getinput.py, getnumber.py, and gettokens.py.  Everything should be in
  one file including all the tests.

Low priority

* Look at fileinfo.py.  It might make more sense to derive it from
  namedtuple.  This should be combined with filesizes.py into one file.
  In fact, what would make the most sense would to be combine them with
  pathlib to produce a pathlib object that also contained the os.stat
  information for a file when desired (it would only retrieve it if you
  ask for the attribute).

* geom_prim.py:  Update properties to modern syntax, utilize matrix.py
  for determinants, as this would remove dependency on numpy.

* u.py and f.py:  A notation for using SI prefixes could be to use
  something like Î¼(N*s/m^2).  This might not be acceptable SI syntax,
  but it would be understandable by anyone and I should use it if the
  tokenizer in the u.py script can be made to utilize it.  A way to do
  this might be to simply insert the equivalent number with a
  multiplication sign on the right when it's encountered; this should
  evaluate OK with python's parser.

* module_dependencies.py:   Is it necessary?  It needs to be rewritten
  to accommodate /plib.  The tools and programs need to be moved in
  first.  

* mystr.py:  Convert token naming to a class.

* sig is a mess of code.  Is it really all needed?  Maybe it would be
  best to move the key stuff to flt and cpx.  It can still be kept
  around for when it's needed.
